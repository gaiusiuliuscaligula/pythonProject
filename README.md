## Repository with Python problem solutions
Welcome to my repository with Python problem solutions! Here you will find various problems and their solutions that I have developed and implemented while learning and applying the Python programming language.

### The repository is organized as follows:
Seminar_1: Input-Output, Conditional Statements 
Seminar_2: Loops, Built-in Types and Operations with Them. 
Seminar_3: Lists and Dictionaries, Functions. 
Seminar_4: Dictionaries, Sets, and Profiling.

Seminar_10: Plotting.

### How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local device: git clone https://github.com/your_user/your_repository.git Open the files with problems and study their implementation and descriptions inside the code. Run the files with problems in a Python development environment or in the terminal to see the execution results. Study the code, experiment, and make your changes for better understanding and mastering Python.
